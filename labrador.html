            All About Labradors
        </h2>

        <p id = "doggies">
            Labradors are very popular among families because of the dogs friendly nature. These dogs have been bred to be hunting
            dogs and to retreive animals for owners. They have a strong desire to please their handlers and they love to work.
            Some of these dogs are even dogs for the blind known as Guide Dogs. There are also service dogs that can help people
            with tasks or alert to someone if something is wrong.
        </p>
        <h3 id = "title">
            Origin
        </h3>
        <p id = "doggies">
            Labrador retreivers actually date back to the late 1830s. European settlers bred these dogs to help with hunting and
            going to the water to retreive things such as ducks. This breed of dog was finally recognized by the AKC (American Kennel
            Club) in 1903.

            Work
        </h3>
        <p id = "doggies">
            Labrador Retrievers are also exceptionally good workers. During the Vietnam War they were used to scout and find
            soldiers whom may have been wounded or deceased.
        </p>

            Health
        </h3>
        <p id = "doggies">
            Labrador retreivers have a life expectancy of about 10 to 12 years. Although keeping these dogs in good health and spirits is pretty easy.
            If you walk your labrador everyday and give them plenty of playtime and fresh healthy food and snacks, they can live to be even older. For example one labrador
            lived to be 27 years and 3 months, holding the Guinness World Record, and his name was Adjutant (Shown Below).

            Labrador puppies are very interesting because from any litter there can be either black, chocolate, or yellow labrador puppies. This can happen depending on three different genes the dogs can have.
            These genes are, MC1R, Agouti and CBD103. Different combinations of these can create one of the three different coat colors.
