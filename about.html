        Hello! My name is Emma Caliendo and I am the creator of this fine website. I created this website for my introduction to computer
        science class for my final project. I chose to make this website about Labrador Retreivers because I have one
        myself named Roxie. She is a three year old Yellow English Labrador Retreiver.

        About Roxie
    </h1>
       <p>
            <p id = "details"> Roxie is a three year old Yellow Labrador Retriever. She has <strong id = "hazel">hazel</strong> eyes and a small brown nose. Roxie loves to lay in the sun during the day and curl up into a ball at night.
                Her favorite toy is her Rat King plush with a long tail that squeaks. Roxie is the <strong>best</strong> dog ever but somethimes she can be annoying like when she jumps on people.
